## Beware of Bandits! 
### Stochastic bandits and their assumptions 

Welcome to my first ever blog post! The research I'm currently doing under UCLA's math department heavily revolves around stochastic bandits and related algorithms.
In this post I'll hash over bandits, their properties, and some important assumptions we'll decompose under. 
<br><br>
Most of what I'm learning comes from a holy grail book some affectionaly coin as the [*Bandit Bible*](https://banditalgs.com). 
Written by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari, this book encompasses everything you need to know about bandit algorithms, but as a cheeky plug, if you would like a shortened version with my own annotations on the subject, keep on reading.

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
