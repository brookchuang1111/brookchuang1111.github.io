## Notes: An Introduction to Statistical Learning

Welcome to the blog post that stores all my R markdowns that serve as notes as I review/re-learn some statistical methods! All R files are downloaded as pdf's using xelatex but you can find the actual code in my github. 

**Disclaimer:** Filled with god-awful typos / nasty run-ons / incomplete sentences! Proceed with caution!
