### Introduction
Most price series are not mean reverting but are geometric random walks. The returns not prices are the ones that are usually randomly distributed around a mean of zero but we can't trade on mean reversion of returns. 

Mean reversion is not the same as anti-serial correlation of returns, which we can actually trade on. 
- Anti-serial correlation of returns = mean reversion of prices

**stationary:** prices that are found to be mean reverting 

#### Illustrating easy profit with mean reversion data
To do this, construct a linear trading strategy that is truly "parameterless". 
We look at time series mean reversion because the prices are supposed to be reverting to a mean determined by it's own historical prices. 

**cross-sectional mean reversion:** cumulative returns of the instruments in a basket will revert ot eh cumulative return of the basket. This also implies that the short term relative returns of the instruments are serially anti-correlated.
