## Title 

Source Material
* [ Agent-based discrete-event market simulation of the Figgie card game](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00879)

---
### Methods 
**Framework:** Figgie is agent-based and a discrete event simulation. Every trader in the market is represented as a separate agent in the simulation and this event can happen at any time in $\mathbb{R}^+$. Two events can occur, 

*consideration event*: In this event, an agent can make an order or not. If an agent decides not to make an order, a *consideration even* is added to the queue. When a new consideration event is being created for agent $i$ its time $t_0 + X$ where $X \sim Exp(C_i)$ and $E(x) = 1/C_i$. $t_0$ is the current simulation time and $C_i$ is the agent's consideration rate.  


*add order event*: In the event of buy/selling, a corresponding order is added to the queue in asset $j$. Once the add order even finishes, a new consideration event is created and the assumption that an agent will only consider a trade again once their order has entered the order book holds. 

The events are stored in a min-heap ordered by time. This makes the complexity for searching for an event $O(1)$ and adding $O(logn)$.  

*Note:* every time an add order event occurs, the order matching mechanism runs for the corresponding assets, and if there is a match the orders are removed from the book. 

#### Figgie Simulation modifications 
1. Agents trade in continuous amounts of cash rather than chips
2. rather than lasting 4 minutes, the simulation lasts 10,000 events
3. In each iteration of gameplay an agent starts off with the same amount of cash so that consecutive runs of gameplay can be more easily compared

### Agent Strategies
In the model, three different kinds of agents and their unique algorithms are used to produce trades in Figgie. We assume that all the goals of the agents is to maximize profit. 

**Algorithm 2: Order-sending based on expected value for asset *j***
- Get two expected values $p_b$ and $p_s$ for buying and selling asset $j$ respectively
- Randomly choose to buy or sell with probability 0.5
- if buying
  - get price p according to $Unif(0, p_b)$
  - let $s$ be the lowest sell order in the market for asset $j$
  - send a limit buy order for asset $j$ with price $min(p, s)$
- else
  - get a price $p$ according to $Unif(p_s, 2p_s)$
  - let $b$ be the highest buy order price in the market for asset *j*
  - send a limit sell order for asset $j$ with price $max(p, b)$
 
**Noise trader** The noise trader computes its expected value for an asset according to 
$$p_j* = b_je^Z \\ Z \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

Where $p_j*$ is its expected value for asset $j, b_j$ is the price of the highest-price buy order in asset $j's$ order book and $\sigma^2$ is the noise trader's variance factor, a parameter that is set to $1$ by default. 

** Fundamentalist** This agent uses different expected values dependent on whether it is to buy or sell a card and determines these values by calculating a posterior distribution given the total number of distinct cards it has seen throughout the game as well as the number of cards of each suit it currently possesses. 

Using these tallies the fundamentalist adds the values of a given suit for each agent together to get the total number of distinct cards which it has seen throughout the whole game for each distinct suit. Then given this collection, the agent calculates the number of combinations by which it could be formed for each of the 12 decks. The distribution of likelihoods is calculated by dividing these numbers by their total sum. The multinomial distribution is represented as
$$m_0, m_1, \dotsm m_11$$

where $m_i$ is the probability that the deck being used is some deck $i$ of one of the possible composition of cards in the Figgie deck. 

[INSERT FIGGIE_COMP]

The fundamentalist has two different expected values for buying and selling because the cards they possess affect the value of each card individually. For example, if  a player possesses 6 spades the most they can gain from an additional spade is 10 as they are already guaranteed a majority, but they can lose up to 60 (half the pot) with an additional 10 if the spades is the goal suit. 

If the player only had 4 spades the expected value of the price of the spade will increase due to the fact of wanting to achieve a majority and in extension, a majority. 

#### Notation
Allow spades, clubs, hearts, and diamonds to be labeled as assets 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We have that given any suit $j$ that decks $3j, 3j + 1, 3j + 2$ are the only ones in which the suit is the goal suit. We define expected value functions $e_b(j, j_n, m)$ and $e_s(j, j_n, m)$ representing the expected values for buying and selling a suit $j$ respectively given that the agent currently possesses $j_n$ cards of that suit and the probability distribution for the deck in play is $m$ as follows: 
$$e_b(j, j_n, m) = \sum_{i=0}^{11}m_iv(i, j, j_n)$$
$$e_s(j, j_n, m)= e_b(j, j_n - 1, m)$$

where v(i, j, j_n) is a measure of the value of purchasing a card of suit $j$ assuming the deck in play is play $i$ and you have $j_n$ cards of suit $j$ in your hand.
