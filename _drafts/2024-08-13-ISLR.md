## Notes: An Introduction to Statistical Learning

(Edit 4/1/25: This is an old post and honestly is pretty shit, but I'm attached so I can't archive it.)

Welcome to the blog post that stores all my R markdowns that serve as notes as I review/re-learn some statistical methods! All R markdowns are downloaded as pdf's using xelatex. 

**Disclaimer:** Filled with god-awful typos / nasty run-ons / incomplete sentences! Proceed with caution!
