## Bad Bernoulli! Information Asymmetry in Bernoulli Bandits 
In this post, we'll be exploring different adversarial environments for bandits. More specifically, we consider a problem where players have incomplete information of the other player and can not communicate with one another. Based on these sets of incomplete information, we can create an algorithm that
